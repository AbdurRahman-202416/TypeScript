# 🚀 TypeScript Practices  

Welcome to my **TypeScript Practices** repository! This repository showcases my journey of learning TypeScript, starting with basic concepts and progressing to intermediate topics. Each section includes practical examples to demonstrate how TypeScript enhances JavaScript with static typing, better error checking, and more structured code.

## 🌱 Basic TypeScript Topics  

### 🟢 1. Introduction to TypeScript  
I started with the basics of TypeScript, understanding its purpose and how it builds on JavaScript. It introduces **static typing**, making code safer and easier to maintain.  

### 🟢 2. Data Types: Built-in / Basic Types  
TypeScript provides fundamental data types like:  
- `string`  
- `number`  
- `boolean`  
- `null`  
- `undefined`  

I practiced using these to enforce type safety in variables and functions.  

### 🟢 3. Data Types: User-Defined Types  
I learned to create custom types for more complex data structures using:  
- `type aliases`  
- `interfaces`  
- `enums`  

These tools help model data precisely and make code reusable and maintainable.  

### 🟢 4. tsconfig  
The `tsconfig.json` file is a configuration file that customizes the behavior of the TypeScript compiler. I explored options like:  
- `target` (to specify ECMAScript version)  
- `strict` (to enforce strict type-checking)  
- `include`/`exclude` (to specify files to compile)  

### 🟢 5. Functions  
Practicing functions was essential to understanding:  
- Parameter type annotations.  
- Return type annotations.  
- Optional and default parameters.  
- Void functions that do not return values.

## 🌟 Intermediate TypeScript Topics  

### 🔷 1. Creating Types from Types  
Using utility types like:  
- `Partial`  
- `Pick`  
- `Omit`  
I created new types dynamically from existing ones to handle complex data with simplicity.  

### 🔷 2. Narrowing  
Type narrowing involves refining variable types based on conditions. I used:  
- `typeof` for primitive types.  
- `instanceof` for class instances.  
- Conditional checks to ensure proper runtime behavior.  

### 🔷 3. Type Guards  
Type guards helped create safer code by verifying object shapes and types at runtime. I implemented:  
- Built-in type guards (`typeof`, `instanceof`).  
- Custom type guard functions.  

### 🔷 4. DOM Manipulation with TypeScript  
I combined TypeScript with DOM APIs to build type-safe web projects. Examples include:  
- Strongly typed DOM elements (`HTMLInputElement`, `HTMLButtonElement`).  
- Handling events (`addEventListener`) with strict typing for event objects.
